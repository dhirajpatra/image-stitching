# Image Stitching with Python

## Overview

Image stitching is a computer vision technique that involves combining multiple images to create a panoramic view. This repository provides a Python implementation of image stitching using the OpenCV library. The process involves loading a set of input images, stitching them together, and generating a final stitched output.

## Usage

To run the image stitching process, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Image Stitching:**

   Run the image stitching script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python image_stitching_simple.py --images path/to/your/images --output output.png
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/images` with the path to your input images directory.

4. **View the Result:**

   After the process is complete, the stitched image will be saved as `output.png` in the same directory. You can view the result to see the panoramic view created from the input images.

## Example

As an example, the script `image_stitching_simple.py` is provided in the repository. This script takes a directory of images as input and generates a stitched output. Feel free to explore and modify the script to suit your specific use case.
